NS-3 Result
======================
In this part we will explain how and where to get the results from our program, which are used for the graphs and saved in the exel file.

As explained in the readme Create_Run_Extract _Results.md file, the run_point_to_point.sh file is responsible for running the simulation with an atomized method in which the client data rate varies from (0. 5Mbps, 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 4Mbps, 8Mbps, 16Mbps, 32Mbps, 64Mbps, 128Mbps, 256Mbps, 512Mbps)  and the wired .txt file is responsible for the storage of the data generated by the WiredTcpClientServer.cc. 
This file contains a lot of information and data that can be confusing when trying to find an exact information. To make things easier, the grep command line can be used to search for lines in files, which in our case is wired.txt.

This grep command has to be writen in  the Kali Linux terminal: 
```
$ grep -E "name of the data you are looking for" scratch/wired.txt 
```
Note: All possibilities that can be searched are written in the run_point_to_point.sh file.


1- Packet loss ratio graph 
---------------------
to get the results of the packet loss ratio on the client-side, type this command:
```
$ grep -E "client packets sent" scratch/wired.txt
```
and then : 
```
$ grep -E "client packets received" scratch/wired.txt
```
to get the results of the packet loss ratio on the server-side, type this command:
```
$ grep -E "server packets sent" scratch/wired.txt
```
and then :
```
$ grep -E "server packets received" scratch/wired.txt 
```
===> Then you have to calculate  the ratio using this formula: 

 $$ Packet \  loss  \ ratio =  \frac{\sum (Packets  \ Sent + Packets  \ Received ) }{ \sum Packets  \ Sent } \times 100$$

2- NS3 number of bytes sent and received client-side (from application layer to physical layer )  graph 
---------------------
 
to get the results of  number of bytes sent and received client-side (from application layer to physical layer ) , type this command to get the number of bytes sent from the appliction layer :
```
$ grep -E "client bytes sent" scratch/wired.txt
```
and then , type this command to get the the number of bytes recived from the physical layer :
```
$ grep -E "Received bytes by 10.1.1.2" scratch/wired.txt
```
3- NS3 total number of bytes transmitted into the channel graph 
---------------------
to get the results of bytes transmitted into the channel  of the client side   , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "Send bytes by 10.1.1.1" scratch/wired.txt
```
to get the results of bytes transmitted into the channel  of the server-side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "Received bytes by 10.1.1.2" scratch/wired.txt
```
4- NS3 End-to-End Delay graph 
---------------------
We need first to get the results of the  average received packet of both the client and server-side 

client side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "client average receive time " scratch/wired.txt
```
server side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "server average receive time " scratch/wired.txt
```
===> Then you have to calculate  the  End-to-End Delay using this formula: 

 $$  End-to-End \   Delay =  \frac{ (client \ average \ receive \ time  \ Sent - server \ average \ receive\ time  \ Sent  ) }{ 2 } $$
 
 5-  NS3 end to end jitter  graph 
--------------------- 
to get the results of   end to end jitter of both the client and server-side 
 
client side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "client reception average jitter " scratch/wired.txt
```
server side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "server reception average jitter" scratch/wired.txt 
```
 
 
 6-  NS3 throughput applcation graph 
--------------------- 
 
 to get the results of  NS3 throughput applcation layer of both the client and server-side 
 
client side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "client average throughput " scratch/wired.txt
```
server side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "server average throughput" scratch/wired.txt 
```
 7-  NS3 throughput physical  graph 
--------------------- 
 
 to get the results of  NS3 throughput physical  layer of both the client and server-side 
 
client side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "Throughput out of 10.1.1.1" scratch/wired.txt
```
server side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "Throughput out of 10.1.1.2" scratch/wired.txt
```

 7-  NS3 collisions  graph 
--------------------- 
 
 to get the results of  NS3 collisions r of both the client and server-side 
 
client side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "Client Number of collisions " scratch/wired.txt
```
server side , type this command:
```
$ grep -E "Server Number of collisions " scratch/wired.txt
```
 8-  NS3  Simulation length  graph 
--------------------- 
 to get the results of Simulation length  , type this command: 
```
$ grep -E "client last packet receive time" scratch/wired.txt
``` 
9-  NS3  Simulator events count  graph 
--------------------- 
 to get the results of Simulation length  , type this command: 
```
$ grep -E "Number of events" scratch/wired.txt
``` 
 NOTE
======================
Let's pretend that all results were extracted in half-duplex mode using CSMA protocol which means that --use_csma  in the  run_point_to_point.sh file eagle one. 
Now we have to change it to zero to switch to full-duplex mode using the PPP protocol. 
All the commands used above are also valid for the full-duplex mode

Analysis of Communication Networks Using Simulators OMNET++ and NS3
======================

Introduction
---------------------
The objective of the Master's thesis project is to investigate and compare the performance of the OMNET++ and NS3 network simulators.
The project creates identical simulations for each simulator and measures key network performance metrics such as packet loss rate, throughput, end-to-end delay, jitter, collisions, number of events, and simulation time.  The focus of the project is on simulating legacy telecommunications technologies such as CSMA/CD and PPP protocols. The results of the simulations are analyzed in depth to determine the relative performance of each simulator.

Technical requirements
---------------------
* OMNET++ 5.6.2 
* NS3 3.34
* Windows operating system
* C++ programming knowledge

Setup
---------------------
* Install windows subsystem for linux (wsl)
* Install OMNET++ and NS3, installation guides and required files are available in the respective Github repositories.
* Clone or download the project repository, one for OMNET++ and one for NS3.
* Follow the guide provided in the repository's README file to set up and create new projects for each simulator.
* Follow the guide and video tutorials provided on how to run the code and extract the results.

Usage
---------------------
* The project includes simulation codes for both OMNET++ and NS3. Once the project is set up, following the instructions in the README file, the user can run the simulation in Both OMNET++ and  NS3 .
* The simulation can be started, paused, and resumed at any time as per the user's preference. This allows the user to control the simulation and make adjustments as needed.
* The results of the simulation can be viewed in real-time on the OMNET++ or NS3 IDE while the simulation is running. This allows the user to monitor the progress of the simulation and make adjustments if necessary.
* The simulation allows the user to adjust various parameters such as client data rate, protocol settings (PPP, CSMA/CD), packet size, client delay, server delay, packet echoed to the client, to analyze the impact of different scenarios on network performance.
* The results can be exported from the IDE in the form of graphs and tables. These results can then be analyzed further using other software such as Excel or Google Colab to gain deeper insights and draw more accurate conclusions.

Results
---------------------
The results of the simulation will  include the following network performance metrics:

* Packet loss rate
* Throughput
* End-to-end delay
* Jitter
* Collisions
* Number of events
* Simulation time

Conclusion
---------------------
The results of the simulation show that both OMNET++ and NS3 are powerful network simulators that can be used to analyze different scenarios and network performance. 
While both simulators have their strengths and weaknesses, the results of the simulation indicate 

The results of the simulations were analyzed and compared to draw conclusions about the relative performance of the two simulators.
The findings of this project indicate that both OMNET++ and NS3 are powerful network simulators that can be used to analyze different scenarios and network performance.

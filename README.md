# Analysis-of-Communication-Networks-Using-Simulators-OMNET-and-NS3
Master Thesis in University of Applied Sciences Berlin : Communication networks are analyzed using NS3 and OMNET++. The two simulators are studied and compared based on network performance criteria such as packet loss rate, throughput, end-to-end delay, jitter, collisions, number of events, and simulation time
